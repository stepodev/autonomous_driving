# Only listen to routers' LAN NIC.  Doing so opens up tcp/udp port 53 to
# localhost and udp port 67 to world:
interface=enp0s25

# dnsmasq will open tcp/udp port 53 and udp port 67 to world to help with
# dynamic interfaces (assigning dynamic ips). Dnsmasq will discard world
# requests to them, but the paranoid might like to close them and let the 
# kernel handle them:
bind-interfaces

# Optionally set a domain name
domain=example.com

# Set default gateway
dhcp-option=3,10.42.43.1

# Set DNS servers to announce
dhcp-option=6,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4

# Dynamic range of IPs to make available to LAN PC and the lease time. 
# Ideally set the lease time to 5m only at first to test everything works okay before you set long-lasting records.
dhcp-range=enp0s25,10.42.43.1,10.42.43.254,5m
